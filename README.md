  <strong>sot_cleaner</strong> is a standalone executable designed to <strong>manipulate Microsoft tracing files</strong> by employing various techniques aimed at mitigating telemetry collection.
<p align="center">By executing tasks such as cleaning the <strong>Windows registry</strong>, <strong>sot_cleaner</strong> removes traces of user activities stored in registry entries. Additionally, it can spoof registry keys, effectively altering <strong>GUID</strong> (Globally Unique Identifier) values associated with user-specific information.
<p align="center">
The program also goes beyond mere registry manipulations by actively cleaning  <strong>Windows credentials</strong>, ensuring tagged login information is not stored or accessible within the system. To bolster identification measures, the program implements  <strong>telemetry filters through</strong> modifications to the hosts file. This involves applying specific filters that  <strong>restrict communication</strong> with telemetry servers.
<p align="center">
  Through the strategic modification of hardware identifiers, <strong>sot_cleaner</strong> allows users to regain access to game or services affected by <strong>Microsoft Hardware ID bans</strong>, including those imposed by errors like <strong>RedBeard</strong>.
<p align="center">
Additionally, the program incorporates features for <strong>MAC address spoofing</strong>, allowing users to obfuscate their device's true MAC address, thereby enhancing privacy and evading certain network restrictions.
